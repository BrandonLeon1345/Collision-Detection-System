# Collision Detection System (ESP32-CAM + Edge Impulse)

## 📌 What This Project Does

This project implements an intelligent **collision detection system** using **computer vision and TinyML**, running directly on an **ESP32-CAM**.
A dataset of *normal* and *crash* situations was captured, cleaned, labeled, and trained on **Edge Impulse**, producing a lightweight image-classification model capable of detecting impact events.
The final model achieves **87% accuracy** and performs **on-device inference** without requiring internet connectivity.

## 🚗 Why This Project Is Useful

Collisions in vehicles, robots, or machinery often happen without immediate detection. This system provides:

* **Low-cost and portable monitoring**
* **Real-time collision identification**
* **On-device inference**, reducing latency and removing the need for cloud services
* **Evidence recording** in risky environments

Its combination of affordability + embedded ML makes it ideal for safety applications, accident prevention, or autonomous systems.

## 🚀 How Users Can Get Started

1. **Hardware Setup**

   * ESP32-CAM with OV2640
   * FTDI programmer (for flashing)
   * MicroSD card (FAT32)
   * Edge Impulse account

2. **Load the Firmware**

   * Upload the provided ESP32-CAM capture code to collect images
   * Then load the inference code generated by Edge Impulse

3. **Train or Modify the Model**

   * Import your dataset into Edge Impulse
   * Use the *Image* preprocessing block
   * Retrain using MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning

4. **Run the System**

   * Power the ESP32-CAM
   * The device will capture frames → preprocess → run the model → determine CRASH or NORMAL
   * Threshold is set at **80% confidence** to reduce false alarms
